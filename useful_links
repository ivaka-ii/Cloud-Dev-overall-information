CMDB - configuration management database
A configuration management database (CMDB) is a file -- usually, in the form of a standardized database -- that contains all relevant information about 
the hardware and software components used in an organization's IT (information technology) services and the relationships between those components. 
A CMDB provides an organized view of configuration data and a means of examining that data from any desired perspective.
